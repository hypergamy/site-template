Welcome to the Estate!  

## Hypergamy.Estate is a look into the so-called 4th Estate, or Masculine and Feminine interactions. 

According to the English Wikipedia, [Estates of the Realm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm) are defined as:  
> The broad social orders of the hierarchically conceived society, recognized in the Middle Ages and Early Modern period in Christian Europe. 
> They are sometimes distinguished as the three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and commoners, and are often referred to by medieval 
> ranking of importance (as the hierarchy was ordained by God) as the First, Second, and Third Estates respectively.  

While Hypergamy.Estate has no interest in matters of religion or God, it's important to note the historical aspects of Western Society.
